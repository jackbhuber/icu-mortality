As one researcher recently suggested, factors predicting mortality in this population and setting remain \"poorly characterized.\"[2] As a result, recent studies have used machine learning to predict mortality after considering the values on a range of features.[1,2,3,4]\n","\n","One important but understudied dimension of this issue is gender. Does gender predict mortality? Are men or women with HF more likely to die in intensive care? If so, does this relationship depend on age? What are the implications for medical practice and prevention? Parissis et al. (2012) conducted a multivariate analysis of data on 4,953 HF patients drawn from a global registry.[5] They found that female HF patients were, relative to male patients, under-treated and under-represented in clinical trials.[5] The authors \"documented the existence of differences in clinical characteristics, co-morbidities, precipitating factors, and therapeutic modalities between male and female patients admitted with AFH (acute heart failure). Despite the variety of the above factors, the length of in-hospital stay and the in-hospital mortality were similar in both genders.\"[5] While that study shed significant light on the topic, it was limited in not examining the interaction between gender and age.\n","\n","This study aims to shed further light on this topic by examining the interactions between gender and age in mortality in the ICU among patients with HF. I will use multivariate methods to isolate the effects of gender, age, and their interaction on mortality controlling for pre-existing differences in comorbidities and vital signs. Based on data from the Centers for Disease Control,[6,7] I hypothesize that, all else equal, men with HF will be more likely to die in the ICU than women, and the effect of gender on mortality will depend on age.\n","\n","This study has implications for medical practice and prevention. A clearer picture of the related mortality risks of both gender and age could help cardiologists and critical care providers tailor care to the needs of specific patients. The general public also stands to benefit from the findings of this study; data suggesting that men are more likely than women to die of HF at a younger age could prompt men to be more proactive about preventing HF from a younger age."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"fda17675","metadata":{"id":"fda17675"},"source":["---\n","## Methods\n","\n","### Data Source\n","\n","The data for this study come from Zhou et al. (2021)[5] available [here](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.0p2ngf1zd) at [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash/about), \"an open data publishing platform and a community committed to the open availability and routine re-use of all research data.\" This dataset includes 49 fields for demographic characteristics, vital signs, and laboratory values on 1,177 adult HF patients. The dataset is a sample of patient-level medical data from the larger [MIMIC-III Clinical Database](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/), \"a publicly available critical care database containing de-identified data on 46,520 patients and 58,976 admissions to the ICU of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, USA, between 1 June, 2001 and 31 October, 2012.\"[8,9,10] This dataset is useful because it contains a large number of diverse patient-level variables which facilitates multivariate analysis.\n","\n","### Measures\n","\n","The outcome measure of all-cause hospital mortality is a binary variable in which a value 1 indicates death and 0 alive. Demographic characteristics include gender (dichotomized as 1 for men and 0 for all others), age (in years at ICU admission), and an interaction term of the two (gender x age). Comorbidities include body mass index (BMI), hypertensive, atrial fibrillation, chronic heart disease (CHD) with no myocardial infarction (MI), diabetes, deficiency anemias, depression, hyperlipemia, renal failure, and COPD, and these are all coded as binary variables in which a value of 1 indicates presence of the condition and 0 indicates absence of the condition. Vital signs include heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, oxygen saturation, and urine output.\n","\n","### Data Analysis\n","\n","I will use multivariate logistic regression to regress mortality on the demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and vital signs with a focus on the adjusted odds ratios for gender, age, and the gender\\*age interaction. These values will illuminate the change in the logs odds of dying associated with being male, older, and older male, controlling for the other measures of comorbidities, vital signs and laboratory values.\n","\n","### Data Preparation"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"1980919b","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":820},"id":"1980919b","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1686429549555,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":19449,"user":{"displayName":"Jack Huber","userId":"06381663771657367718"}},"outputId":"c3e18c70-efea-433e-afab-ffdacc2241c1"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 1177 entries, 0 to 1176\n","Data columns (total 23 columns):\n"," #   Column               Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n","---  ------               --------------  -----  \n"," 0   Mortality            1176 non-null   float64\n"," 1   Gender               1177 non-null   object \n"," 2   Age                  1177 non-null   int64  \n"," 3   BMI                  962 non-null    float64\n"," 4   Hypertensive         1177 non-null   int64  \n"," 5   Hyperlipemia         1177 non-null   int64  \n"," 6   Atrial_fibrillation  1177 non-null   int64  \n"," 7   CHD_no_MI            1177 non-null   int64  \n"," 8   COPD                 1177 non-null   int64  \n"," 9   Diabetes             1177 non-null   int64  \n"," 10  Deficiency_anemias   1177 non-null   int64  \n"," 11  Depression           1177 non-null   int64  \n"," 12  Renal_failure        1177 non-null   int64  \n"," 13  Heart_rate           1164 non-null   float64\n"," 14  Systolic_BP          1161 non-null   float64\n"," 15  Diastolic_BP         1161 non-null   float64\n"," 16  Respiratory_rate     1164 non-null   float64\n"," 17  Temperature          1158 non-null   float64\n"," 18  SpO2                 1164 non-null   float64\n"," 19  Urine_output         1141 non-null   float64\n"," 20  Male                 1177 non-null   int64  \n"," 21  Male*Age             1177 non-null   int64  \n"," 22  Death                1177 non-null   object \n","dtypes: float64(9), int64(12), object(2)\n","memory usage: 211.6+ KB\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   Mortality  Gender  Age        BMI  Hypertensive  Hyperlipemia  \\\n","0        0.0  Female   72  37.588179             0             1   \n","1        0.0    Male   75        NaN             0             0   \n","2        0.0    Male   83  26.572634             0             0   \n","3        0.0    Male   43  83.264629             0             0   \n","4        0.0    Male   75  31.824842             1             0   \n","\n","   Atrial_fibrillation  CHD_no_MI  COPD  Diabetes  ...

I hypothesized that men would be more likely to die in the ICU, and that age and gender would interact such that the effect of gender on mortality would depend on age.\n","\n","The results diconfirm my hypotheses about the relationship between gender, age, and mortality. Controlling for differences in comorbidities and vital signs, gender, age, and the interaction between the two are not statistically significant predictors of mortality. This finding is consistent with the findings of Parissis et al. (2012) in their similar analysis of data from a global registry.[5]\n","\n","This study is limited in three ways. The first, as mentioned previously, is the age of the data. Practice may have evolved in the 11 years since the data were collected. The second is the size of the data set. It includes data on 1,177 patients, and missing values on some variables reduced the sample size for the regression down to 927 patients; and with smaller sample sizes comes the risk of overfitting the model with too many variables. The third limitation is the data set does not include variables on medications or patient care in the ICU. Without this information it is difficult for caregivers to know how to better adapt care to the needs of specific patients.\n","\n","Although this study failed to find evidence of relationships among gender, age, and mortality among HF patients in ICU settings, this line of inquiry is meritorious. Researchers and data scientists should continue to take full advantage of publicly available clinical data to isolate the factors that make the difference between life and death in the ICU."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"fe9beb38","metadata":{"id":"fe9beb38"},"source":["---\n","## References\n","\n","[1] Jentzer JC, Reddy YN, Rosenbaum AN, Dunlay SM, Borlaug BA, Hollenberg SM.
